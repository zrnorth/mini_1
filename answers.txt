Response to Exercise 1:

The pid returned would possibly not be correct. The way we return the pid value is by
placing it in the eax register; if we then schedule a new process, it may
overwrite the eax register. When we finally get around to the current process
again, it will return whatever is in eax, which may be something completely
different. WeensyOS does not save register values, so the value of eax will be
garbage.
